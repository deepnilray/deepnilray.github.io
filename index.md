## Deepnil Ray 
My name is Deepnil Ray and I am an aspiring astrophysicist. I have achieved the honor of being a 3-time national topper at Vikram Sarabhai Science Foundation. In addition, I am an ASTEROID HUNTER who loves to talk about space, astronomy, and astrophotography.

I am thrilled to announce that I recently discovered an asteroid, which has been designated DPR1729. I am excited to continue my work in asteroid detection and exploration.

If you're interested in keeping up with my latest updates and insights on the cosmos, you can follow me on Twitter at [@deepnil_astro](https://twitter.com/deepnil_astro). I post about everything from the latest discoveries in astrophysics to stunning images of galaxies and nebulae.

Thanks for stopping by and I hope you enjoy exploring the universe with me!

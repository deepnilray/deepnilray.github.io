1. Predator Population Dynamics

a. Logistic Growth Equation

The logistic growth model describes how a predator population grows in an environment with limited resources. The formula is:

\frac{dP}{dt} = r_P \cdot P(t) \left(1 - \frac{P(t)}{K_P}\right)

: Predator population at time .

: Intrinsic growth rate of the predator population.

: Carrying capacity of the environment for the predator population.


2. Functional Response of Predators

The functional response characterizes how the consumption rate of prey by predators changes with varying prey densities.

a. Holling's Type II Functional Response

This model accounts for the saturation of predation at high prey densities:

\frac{dP}{dt} = \eta \cdot P(t) \cdot \frac{B(t)}{B(t) + K} - \delta \cdot P(t)

: Prey population at time .

: Attack rate (predation efficiency).

: Half-saturation constant (prey density at which the predation rate is half of its maximum).

: Natural mortality rate of the predator.


3. Predator-Prey Interactions

Incorporating both predator and prey dynamics, we can use a system of equations:

\frac{dB}{dt} = r_B \cdot B(t) \left(1 - \frac{B(t)}{K_B}\right) - \frac{h \cdot P(t) \cdot B(t)}{B(t) + K}

\frac{dP}{dt} = \eta \cdot P(t) \cdot \frac{B(t)}{B(t) + K} - \delta \cdot P(t)

: Prey population at time .

: Intrinsic growth rate of the prey population.

: Carrying capacity for the prey population.

: Rate of predation (how many prey are consumed).


4. Effects of Environmental Factors

To incorporate environmental influences, such as hydrothermal activity, we modify the equations as follows:

\frac{dP}{dt} = \eta \cdot P(t) \cdot \frac{B(t) + H(t)}{B(t) + H(t) + K} - \delta \cdot P(t)

Where:

: Hydrothermal activity at time .


5. Incorporating Time Delays

To account for the time delays in population responses (for instance, reproductive lags), we can extend the model:

\frac{dP}{dt} = \eta \cdot P(t - \tau) \cdot \frac{B(t - \tau)}{B(t - \tau) + K} - \delta \cdot P(t)

: Time delay representing the lag in the predator's response to changes in the prey population.


Conclusion

These formulas can be implemented in the Thalassara ecosystem model to simulate the dynamics between predators and prey while considering environmental factors and ecological interactions. You can adjust parameters like growth rates, carrying capacities, and predation efficiencies based on the specific characteristics of your ecosystem to explore different scenarios and outcomes.
